# WEEK 1
This folder contains the code for 1st coding asignment.
>Consider the following system: two stars of masses m1 and m2, in circular orbit around each other. Consider plane of the system to be perpendicular the plane of the sky (this is the system from the assignment). Find an expression for the line-of-sight velocity of the two objects with time. (Hint: Will you need more information do you need to do this? Assume a reasonable value).
Using the results from the Reading, make a Velocity vs Time plot for a system. Make a function that will take an array of times, and parameters about the system, and return the velocity curve
